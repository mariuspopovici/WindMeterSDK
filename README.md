##WINDmeter SDK for iOS

####Lightweight Integration
The lightweight integration option allows developers to leverage the WeatherFlow WINDmeter app's user interface directly, eliminating the need to build and maintain their own interface for the purpose of displaying real-time wind data.  This option utilizes a custom URL scheme to pass data between the WeatherFlow WINDmeter app and the developer's app.

This option does NOT require embedding an SDK but rather leverages the WeatherFlow WINDmeter app.

You can read more about this option within the read me file for [Lightweight Integration for iOS].

####Full Integration

The full integration option allows developers to utilize the WindMeterSDK directly to obtain raw data from WINDmeter.  This option gives developers full control to display the WINDmeter's raw data in real-time within their app.  

This option requires developers to integrate the WeatherFlow WINDmeter static library into their app, but does not require the WeatherFlow WINDmeter app to be installed on the user's device.
